This Project was done to gain hands-on experience on microservices architecture. The Movie Store consists of Two main services.

1. - Movie Service ([https://github.com/Adeegithub/movie-service](url))
2. - Order Service (This Repo)

Order Service: Handles the order processing, making use of the WebClient to communicate with the Movie Service.
